Hello there! Iâ€™m an aspiring cybersecurity student currently immersed in the dynamic world of cybersecurity studies. With a keen focus on developing cutting-edge solutions, I have already ventured into creating both vulnerability and behavior-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). As an entry-level penetration tester, I thrive on challenging and ensuring robust digital defenses.
When I'm not decoding the complexities of cybersecurity, you can find me under the hood of a car, indulging my passion for automotive work. My curiosity drives my learning, and my optimism fuels my journey, making every challenge an exciting opportunity for growth.
Let's connect and explore the fascinating intersections of technology and security!
